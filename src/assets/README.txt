Data are obtained using DummyJSON Server
Link: "https://dummyjson.com/"

The categories of products have been grabbed using the following API:
https://dummyjson.com/products/categories

Also, they have been grouped into sections to better organize them.

Then, such categories and groups have been hard-coded in data.json.

NOTE: data.json has to be updated if new categories are added.
